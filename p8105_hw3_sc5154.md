This is the solution of P8105 Data Science Homework3.

Load necessary packages and the dataset we are about to use.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Problem 1

``` r
ins_df = instacart %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

The size of the dataset is: there are 1384617 rows and 15 columns in the
dataset.

The variables in the dataset include: order_id, product_id,
add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set, order_number,
order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name,
aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department.

Key variables like `order_id` stands for the order identifier,
`product_id` stands for product identifier, `add_to_cart_order` means
order in which each product was added to cart, `reordered` indicates if
this product has been ordered by this user, `order_dow` stands for the
day of the week on which the order was placed, `product_name` stands for
the name of the product.

Example observations of this dataset can be seen as follows:

``` r
head(ins_df[1:9],5)
## # A tibble: 5 × 9
##   order_id product_id add_to_c…¹ reord…² user_id eval_…³ order…⁴ order…⁵ order…⁶
##      <int>      <int>      <int>   <int>   <int> <chr>     <int>   <int>   <int>
## 1        1      49302          1       1  112108 train         4       4      10

## 4        1      49683          4       0  112108 train         4       4      10
## 5        1      43633          5       1  112108 train         4       4      10
## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​add_to_cart_order, ²​reordered, ³​eval_set,
## #   ⁴​order_number, ⁵​order_dow, ⁶​order_hour_of_day
head(ins_df[10:15],5)
## # A tibble: 5 × 6
##   days_since_prior_order product_name              aisle…¹ depar…² aisle depar…³
##                    <int> <chr>                       <int>   <int> <chr> <chr>  
## 1                      9 Bulgarian Yogurt              120      16 yogu… dairy …

## 5                      9 Lightly Smoked Sardines …      95      15 cann… canned…
## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​aisle_id, ²​department_id, ³​department
```

As you can see, the variable `order_id` takes integer values like 1,
`product_name` are characters like ‘Bulgarian Yogurt’.

Next we answer the required questions.

*Question 1.* How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most
items ordered from?

-   How many aisles are there:

``` r
aisle_cnt = 
  ins_df %>% 
  select(aisle_id, aisle) %>% 
  distinct %>%
  nrow
```

There are 134 aisles totally.

-   Which aisles are the most items ordered from:

``` r
most_aisle = 
  ins_df %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  arrange(-n_obs, aisle) %>%
  head(5)
most_aisle
## # A tibble: 5 × 3
## # Groups:   aisle_id [5]
##   aisle_id aisle                       n_obs
##      <int> <chr>                       <int>
## 1       83 fresh vegetables           150609
## 2       24 fresh fruits               150473
## 3      123 packaged vegetables fruits  78493
## 4      120 yogurt                      55240
## 5       21 packaged cheese             41699
```

It can be seen that the top 5 aisles that most items ordered from are:

‘fresh vegetables’, ’ fresh fruits’, ‘packaged vegetables fruits’,
‘yogurt’, ‘packaged cheese’. And ‘fresh vegetables’ is the most items
ordered from

*Question 2.* Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each
aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.
Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
items_aisle = 
  ins_df %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>%
  arrange(-n_obs, aisle) %>%
  mutate(aisle = factor(aisle))
```

The aisles with top 20 most number of items ordered:

``` r
ggplot(data = items_aisle[1:20, ], mapping = aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n_obs), y = n_obs)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n_obs), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),size =      
  1.0,vjust = -0.25) + 
  labs(x = "Aisle", y = "Number of Items") 
```

![](p8105_hw3_sc5154_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

The aisles with top 21 to 39 most number of items ordered:

``` r
ggplot(data = items_aisle[21:39, ], mapping = aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n_obs), y = n_obs)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n_obs), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),size =      
  1.0,vjust = -0.25) + 
  labs(x = "Aisle", y = "Number of Items") 
```

![](p8105_hw3_sc5154_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

*Question 3.* Make a table showing the three most popular items in each
of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in
your table.

``` r
ins_df %>%
  filter(aisle == 'baking ingredients' | aisle == 'dog food care' | aisle == 'packaged vegetables fruits') %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarize(item_order_times = n()) %>%
  mutate(item_rank = min_rank(-item_order_times)) %>%
  arrange(aisle, item_rank) %>%
  filter(item_rank <= 3)
## # A tibble: 9 × 4
## # Groups:   aisle [3]
##   aisle                      product_name                        item_…¹ item_…²

## 6 dog food care              Small Dog Biscuits                       26       3
## 7 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Baby Spinach                   9784       1
## 8 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Raspberries                    5546       2
## 9 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Blueberries                    4966       3
## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​item_order_times, ²​item_rank
```

*Question 4.* Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which
Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the
week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
ins_df %>%
  filter(product_name == 'Pink Lady Apples' | product_name == 'Coffee Ice Cream') %>%
  group_by(order_dow, product_name) %>%
  summarize(mean_order_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_order_hour
  )
## # A tibble: 2 × 8
##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9
```

## Problem 2

Question 1. Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables and values;
have useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and
encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting
dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("Data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    day_id = case_when(
      day_id == (week - 1) * 7 + 1 ~ (week - 1) * 7 + 5,
      day_id == (week - 1) * 7 + 2 ~ (week - 1) * 7 + 1,
      day_id == (week - 1) * 7 + 3 ~ (week - 1) * 7 + 6,
      day_id == (week - 1) * 7 + 4 ~ (week - 1) * 7 + 7,
      day_id == (week - 1) * 7 + 5 ~ (week - 1) * 7 + 4,
      day_id == (week - 1) * 7 + 6 ~ (week - 1) * 7 + 2,
      day_id == (week - 1) * 7 + 7 ~ (week - 1) * 7 + 3
      ),
    is_weekday = ifelse((day == 'Saturday' | day == 'Sunday'), 0, 1)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = 'activity_index',
    names_prefix = 'activity_',
    values_to = 'activity_cnt'
  ) %>%
  arrange(week, day_id)
head(accel_df)
## # A tibble: 6 × 6
##    week day_id day    is_weekday activity_index activity_cnt
##   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>       <dbl> <chr>                 <dbl>
## 1     1      1 Monday          1 1                         1
## 2     1      1 Monday          1 2                         1
## 3     1      1 Monday          1 3                         1
## 4     1      1 Monday          1 4                         1
## 5     1      1 Monday          1 5                         1
## 6     1      1 Monday          1 6                         1
```

The resulting dataset has 50400 rows and 6 columns.

The existing variables include week, day_id, day, is_weekday,
activity_index, activity_cnt. Where ‘is_weekday’ is the new variable to
indicate whether it is a weekday or weekend; ‘activity_index’ and
‘activity_cnt’ are manually added variables transformed from original
observations using `pivot_longer`. The rest of the variables are time
for activity record.

Question 2. Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the
total activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across
minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a
table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
daily_accel = 
  accel_df %>%
    group_by(week, day_id) %>%
    summarize(daily_activity_cnt = sum(activity_cnt)) %>%
    arrange(week, day_id) 
daily_accel
## # A tibble: 35 × 3
## # Groups:   week [5]
##     week day_id daily_activity_cnt
##    <dbl>  <dbl>              <dbl>
##  1     1      1             78828.
##  2     1      2            307094.
##  3     1      3            340115.
##  4     1      4            355924.
##  5     1      5            480543.
##  6     1      6            376254 
##  7     1      7            631105 
##  8     2      8            295431 
##  9     2      9            423245 
## 10     2     10            440962 
## # … with 25 more rows
```

To see if there are apparent trends, we make a plot to help us analyze.

``` r
ggplot(daily_accel, aes(day_id, y = daily_activity_cnt)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 35), breaks = seq(1, 35, 7)) +
  labs(x = 'Day', y = 'Daily Activity Counts')
```

![](p8105_hw3_sc5154_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->
The daily activities tend to rise with fluctuation within the week of
first two weeks, and drop largely on the first day (Monday) of the next
week. The oscillation range of the third week seems to be narrower than
previous two weeks and more stable. The last two weeks’ daily activity
records are very unstable with large oscillation range.

Question 3. Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the
course of the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour
activity time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the
week. Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based
on this graph.

``` r
accel_df %>%
  mutate(
    activity_index = as.numeric(activity_index),
    hour = floor((activity_index - 1)/60) + 1,
    day = factor(day, levels = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'))
    ) %>%
  group_by(day, hour) %>%
  summarize(activity_mean = mean(activity_cnt)) %>%
  arrange(day, hour) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = activity_mean, color = day)) +
    geom_point() + geom_line() + 
    theme(legend.position = 'bottom') + 
    labs(x = 'Hour of Day', y = 'Hourly Mean Activity', color = 'Day of Week')
```

![](p8105_hw3_sc5154_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->
Based on this graph, we have: \* Generally in each day, the activities
counts tend to be low at late night, midnight and early morning when
maybe the person is still asleep. After 5 am the counts begin to rise
and reach the peak after 10 am, and keep high level across the afternoon
and evening until late night when maybe the person prepares to sleep.

-   For days in week, generally each day in week follows similar
    distribution and pattern on 24-hour activity counts. But there are
    still some extreme points, like that on Sunday and Friday, when the
    level becomes extremely high on Sunday noon and Friday night. There
    may be some connections between these extreme points with the
    beginning and ending of weekends.
